            <h3>Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h3>
            <p>Before you can code using React, you need to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>While HTML and CSS are not required, the JSX syntax used by React is based on HTML. Youâ€™ll need to have a good knowledge of HTML to understand how it works. As for JavaScript, React is built on JavaScript, so there is no escaping learning how to code in JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>You need to know the basics of JavaScript and have a good knowledge of HTML and CSS to get started with React. Your best bet is to focus on learning JavaScript ES6 or beyond. This will provide you with a good foundation upon which you can build your JavaScript skills.</p>
