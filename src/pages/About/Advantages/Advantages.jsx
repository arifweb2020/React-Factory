            <h3>Easy to Learn, Easy to Use</h3>
            <p>Being able to do awesome things is great, but only if you donâ€™t have to spend the rest of your life becoming proficient in a new technology. React is easy to learn and easy to use and comes with a good supply of documentation, tutorials and training resources.
            </p>
            <h3>Reusable Components</h3>
            <p>Components are wonderful and React is based on them. You start with small things, which you use to build bigger things, which you use to build apps. Each component has its own logic and controls its own rendering, and can be reused wherever you need them. </p>
