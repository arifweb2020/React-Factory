            <p>Building a progressive web app is easier than you might expect, and you can do it with basically any JavaScript framework. So, why would you choose React for that?

A web app manifest file should contain the name of the app, the icon to appear on the home screen, and the link that should be opened with the application launch. Such browsers as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Opera, and the Samsung browser support manifests, whereas Safari offers only partial support.</p>
